Appendix A - Case Analysis Requirements 
1.         The   purpose of this assignment   is to   present you with   an   opportunity to   read the   CPA   Canada   Handbook   and   learn   how to apply the accounting guidance   contained therein. The   CPA   Canada   Handbook   can   be   accessed
through the Western   Libraries’ website at:https://edu-knotia-ca.proxy1.lib.uwo.ca/. You will   need to   login using your   UWO credentials.
You can also do a search   on   the   Western   Libraries’   website   for “CPA   Canada   standards”   .   You   will   betaken to   the CPA   Handbook collection. Select   "view online",   and then   click   on the   link   "CPA   Canada   standards  guidance collection   (CPACHB)".
2.         You   must   base your   response solely on the guidance contained within the   CPA   Canada   Handbook.   Any
reference to textbooks, websites, or any other   source   will   not   be   evaluated,   and   no   marks   will   be   awarded to   any content   referenced from these sources. Students are cautioned to only use sources outside of the CPA Canada Handbook for educational purposes, and to ensure your response to this case references the 
Handbook and nothing else. Relevant CPA Canada   Handbook section   references   have   been   provided   in the   case to assist you   in   narrowing your focus.
3.         You are expected to fully   respond to all   the   accounting   issues   you   identify   in   the   case   to   demonstrate   your   depth of   knowledge. Appendix   B outlines a suggested   format   of   how   to   analyze   accounting   issues.
4.         A sample accounting   issue with a solution   has   been   provided for your   review   in   Appendix   C.   You   should
format your   response following a similar   process as demonstrated   in   the   sample   solution.   The   accounting issue   illustrated   in the sample solution   is very simplistic and   you   should   assume   the   accounting   issues   you   will   be   responding to   in the case will   be   much   more complex   and   require greater   analysis. 
The accounting   issues you will   be analyzing   in the case   are   detailed   in   nature.   You   should   not   assume   that   the   in-class coverage was fully   comprehensive. You will find extensive   and   detailed   guidance   in   the   relevant Handbook section   referred to   in this case. You should expect to   read the   entirety   of   the   relevant   Handbook   section when analyzing the accounting   issues.   Not all sentences/paragraphs   within the   relevant   Handbook section will apply to anyone accounting   issue. You   are   expected to   read   each   section   in   its   entirety   and   to determine which guidance   is applicable and which   is   not. The grade   you   receive   on   this   assignment   will greatly depend on the thoroughness of your   response.
5.         You are   not   required to discuss any financial statement   note   disclosure for   these   accounting   issues.
6.         You should aim to fulfill the following objectives   for   each   accounting   issue   analyzed:
a. Thoroughness: you   MUST aim to analyze all relevant Handbook   guidance   (in   the relevant section)   for   each   issue.   If the   relevant   Handbook section you are   reviewing   has   multiple criteria within   it you should analyze   EACH   relevant criterion. Analyzing only   “some” criteria will   result   in   you   only   receiving   “some”   marks.   For example,   if you were   analyzing   revenue   recognition, you would   never analyze just      one   revenue   recognition criteria – you would analyze all the   revenue   recognition criteria. 
b. Case Facts: you   MUST   use case facts to support   EVERY   part of your   analysis.   For   example,   if   you   are
analyzing   mult代 写Intermediate Accounting I – MOS 3360A – Fall 2024Matlab
代做程序编程语言iple criteria for a   particular accounting   issue, you should   have   at   least   one   relevant   (and   usually distinct) case fact to support your   analysis   of   each   criteria.
c. Explain Everything: when writing your   response, you   should   pretend that   the   person   marking   it
knows absolutely   nothing about the case and very   little   about   accounting.   Your   response   should explain everything to them.   Do   not assume or   imply anything   in   your   answer.   If you   don’t   explicitly   state something   in your   response you will   not   receive credit for   it.   For example,   don’tsay, “You should take an   umbrella outside when   it   is   raining”   . You didn’t   explain   WHY.   Instead,   do   say, “You should take an   umbrella outside when   it   is   raining so you   can   hold   it   over   your   head   to   protect   yourself from the   rain”   .
d. Be Concise: you   have a   limited   number of   pages to work   with   for   this   assignment.   As   such,   make   your   response concise. Your analysis should   be complete   and thorough,   but   also   concise. There   are   no
extra   marks awarded for   unnecessary words or fancy writing   styles.
7. Handbook Referencing: you   must copy   and   paste   relevant   sentences/paragraphs   directly from   the   CPA
Canada   Handbook and   include them   in your   response as demonstrated   in the   sample   response   in Appendix   C.   When doing this,   please   remember to:
a.          State which section/paragraph you are   including, and
b. Italicize anything copied and   pasted from the   Handbook. This   will   allow the   person   marking   your   assignment to   know what   is copied from the   Handbook vs. what   is your   response.
You will   likely find   it effective to copy and   paste   a   portion   of the   Handbook   section   that   applies to   the accounting   issue you are writing about, and then   immediately   analyze the   guidance   using   applicable   case   facts. 
In the   CPA Canada   Handbook, you will see some text   that   is   italicized   and   some   that   is   not.   The   italicized paragraphs are the “   principles”   . The text   included   underneath   is to   help   provide further guidance on   how   to   interpret and apply what   is   listed   in the   principle. 
For   example:
MEASUREMENT OF INVENTORIES Cost 
.04 Property, plant and equipment shall be recorded at cost. 
.05             The cost of an item of property,   plant   and   equipment   includes the   purchase   price   and   other   acquisition   costs
such as option costs when an option   is exercised,   brokers'   commissions,   installation costs   including architectural, design and engineering fees, legal fees, survey costs,   site   preparation   costs, freight   charges, transportation insurance costs, duties, testing and preparation   charges.   It   may   be appropriate   to   group   together   individually insignificant items of property,   plant and   equipment. 
It   is acceptable to   include   information from   both areas   in your   response   if   it   is   relevant to your   discussion.   It   is   important   not to   dump   lengthy   paragraphs from the   Handbook   into   your   response without applying the guidance to case facts.   If something from the   Handbook   is   in your   response   but you   haven’t   interpreted   it   in   your own words afterwards as to   how   it   applies to your   case,   or   applied   case   facts   against   it,   consider   if you actually   need to   have that guidance   in your   response. 
8. Conclude: you should   remember to definitively   conclude   or   make   a   recommendation   on   each   accounting   issue. Your conclusion /   recommendation should:
a.          Summarize why you are   reaching that   conclusion or   providing that   recommendation,
b.          Discuss the   required   impact to the financial statements,   and
c.          Include journal entries   if you   believe that will   help   illustrate   your   conclusion.
Before you   begin,   please   re-read these   instructions again. Then,   read them again   before finalizing your assignment. Comprehensive   professional answers   are expected that are fully   explained   and   supported   by   case   facts. Goodluck! 
Appendix B - How to Analyze an Accounting Issue using the CPA Way
You should follow the following format for analyzing your accounting   issues   in   accordance   with “The   CPA   Way”   .
1. Assess the situation – This should   be a   brief description   of what you think   the   accounting   issue   is. The
purpose of this section   is to   highlight to your   reader the   key   concerns   in the   case   and   explain   what   you hope to accomplish through your analysis. This should   be   1-2   sentences to   explain   how   the   item   has   been   accounted for   using case facts and what you think   the   issue   is   (or   state   that   it   hasn’t   been   accounted for yet). You   may   pose a question at the end   to   make   it   clear   what   you   hope   to   accomplish   through   your analysis   (for example, “Does this   item   meet the definition of an   asset   under the   conceptual framework?”).
2. Analyze the issue –   In order to   properly analyze   an   issue, you   need   to   have   a   combination   of relevant 
technical guidance AND relevant case facts to achieve   depth.   Handbook   guidance   with   no   case   facts   is   not   enough,   nor   is   listing case facts that aren’t   linked to   Handbook guidance – you   need BOTH.   Simply inserting guidance from the   handbook   into your   response without applying case facts   will   result   in   very   few   (or   no)   marks   being awarded.   Here are some   potential formats you   can   use: 
Issue with criteria 
Handbook section   says that the following 3 criteria must be met in order to   : 
• Criteria 1 –   MET/NOT   MET – followed   by   case fact   to   support.
• Criteria 2 –   MET/NOT   MET – followed   by case   fact   to   support.
• Criteria 3 –   MET/NOT   MET – followed   by case   fact   to   support.
Issue with a specific technical rule 
Handbook section   says that …. 
In this case,   …   …   .   (discussion of   how the technical   rule applies   using case facts)
3.          Conclude and Advise - You   need to   make a clear conclusion   or   recommendation   based   on your   analysis.
In addition, ensure you answer the   question “so what”   after   you   are   done   concluding.   If   you   are   given
information that allows you to quantify the impact from the   accounting   issue,   do   so   here.   Does this
require an adjustment in the financial statements?   If so,   provide   the journal entry if   possible.   Even   if you   don’t   have   numbers to quantify,   providing the journal entry   helps to show you   understand the   related
accounting. Also, consider   if the   accounting   issue   impacts a central theme   in the   case,   such   as   compliance   with a debt covenant,   a   bonus   calculation,   etc.
